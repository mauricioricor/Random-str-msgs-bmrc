# random-str-msg

Whenever I start a new project, I don't know what to write for the first commit. After doing a â€œgit initâ€ there is technically nothing there...

## Install

```npm
npm install -g Random-str-msgs-bmrc
```

# Usage

```bash
 Random-str-msgs-bmrc
```

# Contributing

If someone wants to add or improve something, I invite you to collaborate directly in this repository: [Random-str-msgs-bmrc](https://github.com/mauricioricor/Random-str-msgs-bmrc)
